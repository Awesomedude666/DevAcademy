## üìù Overview

In the rapidly evolving tech landscape, aspiring developers often struggle to find structured, high-quality courses, while skilled educators lack the tools to easily create and monetize their own content. DevAcademy addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive, full-stack e-learning platform that serves as a two-sided marketplace.

The platform empowers educators with a dedicated dashboard to design rich curricula, upload course materials, set pricing, and track their earnings. For students, DevAcademy offers a seamless learning experience, from discovering new courses and processing secure payments with Stripe to tracking their progress through an interactive course player. By handling the complexities of user authentication, payment processing, and media management, DevAcademy delivers a professional and intuitive experience for both sides of the educational marketplace.
